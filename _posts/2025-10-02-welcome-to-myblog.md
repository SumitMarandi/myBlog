Hello world! üëã

I'm **Sumit Marandi** ‚Äî a computer science engineer and fullstack developer from India. After months of thinking about it, I've finally created this space to document my journey, share experiences from real projects, and write about the ideas, problems, and solutions that shape my day-to-day as a developer.

## Why this blog?

As developers, we're constantly learning, solving problems, and discovering better ways to build things. Yet, so much of this knowledge stays trapped in our heads or scattered across random notes. I wanted to change that by:

- **Learning in public** and keeping myself accountable
- **Sharing the things I wish I knew earlier** when I was starting out
- **Connecting with fellow developers** and exchanging perspectives
- **Building a durable archive** of notes, experiments, and lessons learned

## What you can expect

This won't be just another tech blog with generic tutorials. I'm planning to share:

### üõ† **Practical Content**
- **Real-world tutorials** based on actual projects I'm working on
- **Deep dives** into React, Expo, PHP, Node.js, MongoDB, and Docker
- **Debugging stories** ‚Äî the issue, the dead ends, and finally, the fix

### üèó **Architecture & Design**
- **System design decisions** explained with context and trade-offs
- **Code patterns** that have served me well (and some that haven't)
- **Performance optimization** techniques from the trenches

### üí° **Learning & Growth**
- **New technology explorations** as I learn them
- **Productivity tips**, tooling, and developer workflows that work
- **Personal reflections** on growth, mindset, and the craft of building software

### üìä **Project Insights**
- Behind-the-scenes looks at [unpost club](https://github.com/SumitMarandi) and other projects
- **Lessons learned** from both successes and failures
- **Open source contributions** and what I learned from them

## My writing principles

- **Keep it simple, readable, and useful** ‚Äî no fluff or buzzword bingo
- **Prefer clarity over cleverness** ‚Äî if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it
- **Focus on fundamentals before frameworks** ‚Äî tools change, principles endure
- **Share honestly** ‚Äî including mistakes, dead ends, and trade-offs

## A bit about my current work

I'm currently working on **unpost club**, an exciting project that's teaching me a lot about modern fullstack development. I'm also diving deep into:

- **React ecosystem** for building better user interfaces
- **Mobile development** with React Native and Expo
- **Database optimization** with MongoDB and MySQL
- **Containerization** with Docker for consistent deployments

Each of these areas will likely spawn multiple posts as I document what I learn.

## Posting cadence

I'm aiming to publish **consistently** rather than frequently. Some posts will be thorough deep dives that take time to research and write. Others will be shorter notes or quick wins from the week.

Quality over quantity, always.

## Join the journey

This is just the beginning, and I'm excited to build this in public. Here's how you can be part of it:

- **Subscribe** via the [RSS feed](/myBlog/feed.xml) to get updates
- **Reach out** at [sm@marandi.in](mailto:sm@marandi.in) if something resonates or if you have questions
- **Share topics** you'd like me to explore ‚Äî I'm always looking for interesting problems to dive into
- **Connect with me** on [GitHub](https://github.com/sumitmarandi) to see what I'm building

## What's next?

My next few posts will likely cover:
- Setting up a modern React development environment
- Docker best practices I've learned the hard way
- MongoDB performance optimization techniques
- Building responsive UIs with CSS Grid and Flexbox

## A promise to you

I promise to:
- Write only about things I've actually used or built
- Include code examples and real scenarios
- Be honest about limitations and trade-offs
- Keep improving the format based on your feedback
